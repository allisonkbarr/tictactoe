NAME
----
Tic Tac Toe


SYNOPSIS
--------
Player vs. computer version of the classic game with a simple AI.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
AI will recognize and take a winning or blocking move (i.e. when 2 of 3 spots in a winning combination
are taken by either Xs or Os), and otherwise will take a random, empty space. Player always goes first.

JavaScript for the game is split between the js/game.js file, which contains all the game logic, and the
js/main.js file, which stores the data and executes the game functionality.

In addition, there are tests written with Mocha in the test/game.js file.


INSTALLATION
------------
Dev dependencies:
  * babel-register ^6.3.13 (https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/)
  * mocha ^2.3.3 (https://mochajs.org/)
